## **Utilities** contains **2** sub-folders:

## - **Libraries** contains *outside library* that is used in the project.
## - **Helpers** contain files that help developers to easily build the app such as custom TextField, Extension, and other more

## **Note:**
## - In **Libraries**, there should be only libraries that couldn't be use with CocoaPods.
## - In **Helpers**, sometimes could be messy without grouping, so feel free to group them the way you think that is easy for you.
